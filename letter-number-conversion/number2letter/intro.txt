So I came across this issue today.
I wanted to create a group called J145916 in slack which I couldn't because apparently numbers are invalid characters in group names in slack, which I thought kinda sucks...

Previously I've used numbers in names if a name I wanted to take was already take or sometimes just for lols or stuff like that.
So I thought this time I'm gona have to come up with the reverse case - a number to letter conversion.
